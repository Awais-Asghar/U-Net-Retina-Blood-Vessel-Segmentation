# U-Net-Retina-Blood-Vessel-Segmentation
This project focuses on segmenting retinal blood vessels from fundus images using a U Net based deep learning model. The goal is to build a simple, clear, and reproducible pipeline that loads the dataset, pairs images with their masks, trains a U Net, evaluates the model, and visualizes the predicted segmentation maps.
